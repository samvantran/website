10.15.13
Changed #home bg img. Added navbar top of page. Added About page. Did away with updates on page; will keep those here. Site is not mobile friendly; not sure where the miss in CSS file is; needs investigating.

----------------------------------------
Finally got this badboy on github

These are the changes that have already taken place prior to git commit

10.9.13
Added a normalize.css file for cross browser functionality. Updated new Post CSS; separated divs into content and date [using display: inline-blocks for dynamic length (took some digging!)]; overall cleaned it up.

10.5.13
Yessss.. finally figured out how to cover the entire broswer window w/ my bg img. CSS: body {padding:0; margin:0} and background-size: cover. Learned how to throw in non web-safe fonts. Added a separator div w/ 80% width bar.

10.2.13
Added top navbar bg color; floated links right; added bg img; changed newUpdate css. [note to self: this would be really good for github... should look into that more].

10.1.13
GENESIS
I know this is straight up ghetto but I finally put up my own website! *applause
