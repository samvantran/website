12.1.13
New blog post.

11.18.13
Fixed the social icons. Was not clickable before; now is.

11.16.13
Added a footer div with social icons at bottom. Added transform: scale(1.1, 1.1) to magnify social icons 1.1x on hover. Enabled 'single-pageness' by making #main div 1000px and href to #contact. Tried using dabblet as new sandbox (more accurate preview than cssdesk. Also has capability to update git but I'm wary of security access).

11.9.13
Fixed the mobile problem: created a div and set background: url to img; gave it absolute positioning w/ top&left:0. Success!

11.7.13
Holy crap spent the majority of the evening trying to fix a faulty update I did to the site. Tried to put up multiple divs w/ images for single-pageness but that crashed all pics; had nothing up except the navbar. Blog worked though. Took forever and eventually just had to copy/paste from last push on GH; still didn't work. Realized an hr later I copied html code from blog which has a diff stylesheet. Felt/Feel like such an idiot.

11.1.13
Added a blog post and a new page (blog). Threw in some quick css. Starting to tinker with single page design. 

10.30.13
Changed contact to blog. Going to blog about what I learned this month. Added some more CSS. Learned how to space underlines from text using border-width and position. Changed a:hover color to orange. Added border-bottom line to mobile header. Still having trouble with Android capability (specifically HTC One). Spoke with a UI engineer today and he suggested floating the header, putting img inside the body and setting h:100% w:100%.

10.26.13
Learned about media queries and was able to get site working on iphones. Very naiz...

10.23.13
Changed html. used <ul> and <li> for my navbar links instead of divs. Allowed me to float without the reverse order problem. Still debating if I'll keep that. Been reading about CSS style and experimenting mostly.

10.15.13
Changed #home bg img. Added navbar top of page. Added About page. Did away with updates on page; will keep those here. Site is not mobile friendly; not sure where the miss in CSS file is; needs investigating.

10.10.13
Finally got this badboy on github! These are the changes that have already taken place prior to git commit:

----------------------------------------

10.9.13
Added a normalize.css file for cross browser functionality. Updated new Post CSS; separated divs into content and date [using display: inline-blocks for dynamic length (took some digging!)]; overall cleaned it up.

10.5.13
Yessss.. finally figured out how to cover the entire broswer window w/ my bg img. CSS: body {padding:0; margin:0} and background-size: cover. Learned how to throw in non web-safe fonts. Added a separator div w/ 80% width bar.

10.2.13
Added top navbar bg color; floated links right; added bg img; changed newUpdate css. [note to self: this would be really good for github... should look into that more].

10.1.13
GENESIS
I know this is straight up ghetto but I finally put up my own website! *applause
