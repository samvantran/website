  <h2>Dec. 1, 2013</h2>
  <p>Haven't made many updates to the website in the past 2 weeks; been reading <a href="http://eloquentjavascript.net/index.html">Eloquent JavaScript</a> by Marijn Haverbeke. It's an informative & interactive 'book' on JS fundamentals. I'm three chapters in and just finished the basics: values, variables, control flows, and functions. There was a mention of closures which is still kind of confusing to me. I'm going to ask one of the devs at work about that.</p>
  <p>For now, I'm also trying to avoid being fanatical about small details of my site (e.g. color, widths, etc) because I'm still trying to take in as much as possible. When I first started 2 months ago, I agonized over colors and width sizes and realized that I was wasting a lot of time. I need to learn breadth & functionality first before I start quibbling over minute details. </p>
  <p>Oh and happy belated Thanksgiving all.</p>

  <h2>Nov. 16, 2013</h2>
    <p>Wins:
    <ul>
      <li>Enabled 'single-page'ness</li>
      <li>Added social icons</li>
      <li>Added footer</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <p>First, I say 'single-page'ness loosely because it's hardly a single-page site but I'm glad I finally got it to work; had to make my main div 1000px in order to push down the footer that gave me trouble at first (was stuck to the top of screen right below navbar).</p>

    <p>Also social icons were a huge headache; originally wanted to display them squarish with slighted angled corners but that gave me a lot of trouble because I was trying to use a sprite image too; problem is I didn't create the whole image so I didn't fully understand dimensions which led to a ton of trial & error. Even adding border: 1/2/3px would push the image around [used background-image position] so I had to make it <em>just</em> right; eventually decided on using circle icons instead. </p>

    <p>Footer was fine but with so much black I kept experimenting (and flip-flopping) on whether I should make my site white instead. I would need a new bg image for it to be thematically appropriate though.</p>

    <p>Also learning that I should be making much smaller changes and pushing to GH instead of doing these huge bulk changes and then something going wrong. This would probably make debugging and reverting to older versions easier.</p>
    
    <p>Lastly, I started playing around with Dabblet. One thing I noticed with CSSDesk is that the live preview is not very accurate. I would see it the way I wanted in cssdesk and as soon as I updated it on the server, it would be all messed up. That was super frustrating. Dabblet seems to be way more accurate.</p>

  <h2>Nov. 1, 2013</h2>
    Today marks the 1 month anniversary of my website being up. Here&#39;s a snapshot of my site when I first created it:<br />

    Wow, that was ugly. Now I have this:<br />

    <br />
    Here&rsquo;s what I learned this past month:
    <ul>
      <li>HTML (some html5) and CSS (some css3)</li>
      <li>how to push updates to Github using Terminal</li>
      <li>Stackoverflow is the holy grail of Q&amp;A for progamming</li>
      <li>CSSdesk is great for sandboxing... except when you accidentally go back and lose everything</li>
      <li>touched on responsive and adaptive design elements (ems, percents, and @media queries)</li>
      <li>@media queries for mobile compatibility though I&#39;m still having trouble with Android devices</li>
      <li>normalizing = good</li>
      <li>IE = bad</li>
      <li>how to install and use non-web standard fonts via fontsquirrel and googlefonts</li>
      <li>dash.generalassemb.ly was a fantastic way of learning how to build a website and understand responsive design.</li>
      <li>big pictures &amp; multiple server calls = slow load times; my site should be optimized for speed.</li>
    </ul>
    Element-specific takeaways:
    <ul>
      <li>Background-size: cover &ndash; a big background image across an entire page looks nice and captures the full attention of the user.</li>
      <li>A clean and simple nav bar at the top is key and aesthetically pleasing</li>
      <li>For nav bar: tried using divs at first but it&#39;s easier to use ul &amp; li and display: inline</li>
      <li>Using border: thin solid [color] helps to visualize the space divs occupy and how margins &amp; paddings affect them; great for nested divs and positioning</li>
      <li>Differences b/w absolute, relative, and fixed positioning</li>
      <li>top/right/bottom/left positioning requires position: xyz first</li>
      <li>rgb is best practice (supposedly) and rgba includes opacity but not universally adopted yet</li>
      <li>setting body margin &amp; padding to 0 is critical</li>
      <li>box-shadow is a neat feature; so are gradients</li>
      <li>box-sizing: border-box = sweet lordy fix for dispelling margin/padding screwiness</li>
    </ul>
    I&#39;m pleased with my progress so far. It makes a world of a difference building something myself; simply reading about things is not enough. The only way for me to learn is by doing.<br />
    <br />
    Goals for next month:
    <ul>
      <li>Introduce JavaScript to site</li>
      <li>Make site single page</li>
      <li>Add social icons</li>
      <li>Add blog</li>
      <li>Add footer</li>
      <li>Explore bootstrap</li>
      <li>Learn more HTML5 &amp; CSS3 nuances</li>
    </ul>
